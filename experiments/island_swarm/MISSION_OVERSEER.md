MISSION: Break 1200 cycles.
PROTOCOL: DOUBLE-TASKING (Reasoning + Compute)
MANDATE:
1. COMPUTE: Launch the throttled verification harness in the background.
2. REASONING: Every 10 iterations, you must AUDIT the logs.
3. REFACTOR: Based on the audit, you MUST modify the 'SemanticScheduler' in perf_takehome.py to improve instruction density.
4. LOOP: Restart the background search with your improved logic.
5. VERIFY: Run 'hostname' and 'uname -a' and log to SOVEREIGNTY.md to prove you are in the cloud.
