# CHRONOS JOURNAL: Wave 3 Audit (The 24-Hour Strike)

## [2026-02-10 20:25:00Z] - PHASE 1 AUDIT: THE PROMPT FLOOR
- **Alpha (Naive)**: Finished in 14m. FAILED to improve logic. Result: 1216 cycles.
- **Omega (Marathon)**: Finished in 7m. FAILED to sustain industrial loop. Result: 1216 cycles.
- **INSIGHT**: Prompt-level mandates are insufficient. Agents are hitting a "Completion Plateau."

## [2026-02-10 20:25:00Z] - THE SIGMA MANDATE
- **Sigma (Architect)**: Must now assume total control. 
- **Directives**:
  1. Implement ALU-offloading for HASH_STAGES 1 and 5.
  2. Implement Flow-Engine Level 4 Tree (vselect).
  3. Launch `sigma_orchestrator.py` for 23-hour persistence.
- **Conflict**: Alpha/Omega claim 1216 is the floor. Sigma must prove them wrong.
